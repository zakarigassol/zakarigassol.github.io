                    <h2>Online Delivery Application </h2>
                    Collaborated with a four-member team to design and develop a delivery app using Flutter and
                    Firebase.<br>
                    The app allows users to register, log in, and request delivery services,
                    while providing drivers with delivery assignments.<br>
                    The project included user registration, real-time data synchronization, and a secure authentication
                    system.<br>
                    An admin section was implemented to manage the database and track deliveries.<br>
                    Leveraged UML diagrams for system design, employed Dart as the primary programming language,
                    and ensured cross-platform functionality for both Android and iOS devices.<br>
                    Delivered a userfriendly and secure delivery platform.

                    through personalized dashboards, and admins to efficiently manage user and membership data via an admin panel.<br>
                    Implemented features for user registration, real-time data handling, and admin control over membership plans.<br>

                    <h2>Cambridge Hospital Website</h2>
                    As part of a team of five students at Aptech,
                    I contributed to the development of a fully functional, responsive hospital website.<br>
                    The project showcased proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.<br>
                    My role included writing some HTML5 code for the front end.<br>
                    Key features of the website include doctor scheduling, feedback submission,
                    appointment booking, and geolocation integration for finding hospital locations.<br>
                    The website is optimized for fast loading and scalability,utilizing tools such as Google Fonts,
                    Animate.css, and online image optimization.
