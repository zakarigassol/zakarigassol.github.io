          <h1>About Me</h1><br>
          <p>Driven by curiosity and a commitment to growth, I began my journey with technology early, fueled by a fascination with computers and the internet. My studies have equipped me with valuable skills across IT fields, from web development to network configuration, security, and hardware maintenance. I earned an Advanced Diploma in Software Engineering at Aptech Computer Education in Nigeria and went on to complete my BSc in Information Technology at Eastern Mediterranean University (EMU) in Cyprus, where I graduated with honors and was recognized as a Top Student. EMU offered a rich cultural experience, blending learning with diverse campus activities like the Spring Festival and Nations Tournament, which fostered a sense of community and global perspective.</p>

          <p>My academic and project work includes a variety of hands-on experiences, such as developing a Horse Riding Membership website using PHP and working with a team to build a responsive hospital management website. For my final year project, I collaborated on successfully building an online delivery app using Flutter (Dart) and Firebase, which enhanced my technical knowledge and underscored the importance of effective teamwork in project success. My professional interests include cybersecurity, data sciences, computer networking, and cloud technologies, with a specific focus on creating secure, efficient solutions that enhance organizational resilience. Passionate about lifelong learning, I have pursued certifications and continue to develop my skills in these areas.</p>
