          <h1>About Me</h1><br>
          <p> Driven by curiosity and a commitment to growth, I began my journey in technology early, fueled by a fascination with computers and the internet. My academic and professional experiences have equipped me with valuable skills across various IT fields, including web development, network configuration, cybersecurity, and hardware maintenance.

            <p>I earned an Advanced Diploma in Software Engineering from Aptech Computer Education, a globally recognized training institute founded in 1986. Aptech offers a wide range of IT courses and has over 1,300 learning centers in more than 40 countries, including 26 training centers in Nigeria. I studied at the Kano (Maiduguri Road) center, where I completed a two-year pathway program designed to prepare students for further education at affiliated universities. Aptech collaborates with top institutions in the UK, Dubai, Cyprus, Malta, Malaysia, and Mauritius, enabling students to transfer and complete their bachelor's degrees in related fields.</p>

          <p> Following this pathway, I pursued a BSc in Information Technology at Eastern Mediterranean University (EMU) in Cyprus, where I graduated with honors and was recognized as a Top Student. Studying at EMU provided not only a strong academic foundation but also a rich cultural experience, blending learning with diverse campus activities such as the Spring Festival and Nations Tournament, which fostered a strong sense of community and a global perspective.            
            This educational journey has shaped my technical expertise and broadened my outlook, reinforcing my passion for innovation and problem-solving in the field of information technology.</p></p>

          <p>My academic and project work includes a variety of hands-on experiences, such as developing a Horse Riding Membership website using PHP and working with a team to build a responsive hospital management website. For my final year project, I collaborated on successfully building an online delivery app using Flutter (Dart) and Firebase, which enhanced my technical knowledge and underscored the importance of effective teamwork in project success. My professional interests include cybersecurity, data sciences, computer networking, and cloud technologies, with a specific focus on creating secure, efficient solutions that enhance organizational resilience. Passionate about lifelong learning, I have pursued certifications and continue to develop my skills in these areas.</p>
